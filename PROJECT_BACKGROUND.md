### Full Functionality List: Python-Log-Analyser

**Core Functionality (Minimum Viable Product - essential for a working script):**

1.  **Log File Reading:**
    * Ability to open and read a specified log file line by line.
    * Basic error handling for `FileNotFoundError`.

2.  **Log Line Parsing:**
    * **Implement `parse_log_line()` function:**
        * Use regular expressions (`re` module) to extract key fields from each log line (e.g., IP address, timestamp, event description/message, status code, user, etc.).
        * Handle the specific format of your chosen log file (e.g., Linux `auth.log` or Apache `access.log`).
        * Convert the timestamp string into a `datetime` object for time-based comparisons.
        * Return structured data (e.g., a dictionary or custom object) for successful parses, `None` for unparseable lines.

3.  **Suspicious Activity Detection:**
    * **Implement `detect_suspicious_activity()` function:**
        * Define and track at least one suspicious pattern relevant to your chosen log type.
            * *Example (Auth Logs):* Multiple failed login attempts from the same source IP within a defined time window.
            * *Example (Web Logs):* Multiple requests to a non-existent sensitive path (e.g., `/admin`, `/.git/config`) or repeated 401/403 errors from one IP.
        * Maintain state (e.g., a dictionary mapping IP addresses to a list of timestamps) to count and track events within the time window.
        * Return an alert message (string) if the threshold for the pattern is met, otherwise `None`.

4.  **Basic Alerting:**
    * **Implement `send_alert()` function:**
        * Print the alert message to the console.
        * Write the alert message (with a timestamp) to a dedicated `security_alerts.log` file.

5.  **Configuration:**
    * Define configurable variables for `LOG_FILE_PATH`, `ALERT_THRESHOLD_COUNT`, `ALERT_TIME_WINDOW_MINUTES`, and `ALERT_LOG_PATH` at the top of the script.

**Detection & Alerting Enhancements:**

6.  **Continuous Monitoring (Tail-like Functionality):**
    * Modify the script to continuously read new lines appended to the log file in real-time (like `tail -f` in Linux).
    * Include a small `time.sleep()` delay between checks to prevent high CPU usage.

7.  **Multiple Detection Patterns:**
    * Add logic for detecting additional suspicious patterns.
        * *Example (Auth Logs):* Repeated `sudo` failures, successful login from new/unusual user accounts.
        * *Example (Web Logs):* SQL Injection attempts (e.g., `union select`, `' or '1'='1`), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attempts (e.g., `<script>`, `onerror`), directory traversal attempts (`../`).

8.  **Alert Cooldown/Suppression:**
    * Prevent the script from sending an overwhelming number of identical alerts for the same source/event within a short period.
    * Implement a cooldown period for alerts (e.g., don't re-alert for the same IP's brute force for X minutes after the initial alert).

9.  **Rich Alert Data:**
    * Include more context in the alert message, such as the specific log line that triggered it, the number of events, and the time range.

**Log Source & Parsing Flexibility:**

10. **Dynamic Log File Selection:**
    * Allow the user to specify the log file path as a command-line argument when running the script (using `sys.argv` or `argparse` module).
    * (Advanced) Allow specifying a directory to monitor multiple log files.

11. **Configurable Log Format (More Advanced):**
    * If you expand to different log types, allow the script to be configured with different regex patterns based on the log source (e.g., using a small JSON or INI config file for log definitions).

**Operational & Management Features:**

12. **Basic Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
    * Use the `argparse` module for more robust command-line argument parsing (e.g., `--log-file`, `--threshold`, `--time-window`).

13. **Verbose Output / Debugging Mode:**
    * Add an option (e.g., `--verbose` or `--debug`) to print more detailed information for troubleshooting.

14. **Graceful Shutdown:**
    * Handle `Ctrl+C` (KeyboardInterrupt) gracefully, so the script can be stopped cleanly without errors.

**Advanced / Future Scope Features:**

15. **Email Notifications:**
    * Integrate `smtplib` to send actual email alerts to a specified address for critical detections.

16. **Integration with External Services (e.g., IP Reputation):**
    * For detected suspicious IPs, query an external API (e.g., VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB - check API terms) to check the IP's reputation and include this in the alert.

17. **Basic Reporting:**
    * Generate a summary report of daily or weekly alerts (e.g., a simple text file or CSV).

18. **Web Interface (Most Advanced):**
    * Develop a very basic web interface (using Flask or Django) to display alerts or allow configuration of the script. This would be a significant undertaking.
